    Types representing the Musaico I/O classes.
  </p>

  <p>
    Each Type must have TypeCasters for <i>all</i>
    types defined in the primitive types module
    (in Java: musaico.types.primitive.types).
  </p>

  <p>
    Thus, for example, an IntType is castable to an IntegerReference,
    an EndPosition is castable to a StringType, a StartPosition is
    castable to an IntType (0), and so on.
  </p>


  <p>
    In Java, all I/O types and their raw values must be
    Serializable.
