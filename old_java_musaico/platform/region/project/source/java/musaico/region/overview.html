    Descrptions of the spaces occupied by data structures,
    and how to step through them linearly.
  </p>

  <p>
    For example, a vector might be 17 elements in size and
    stepped through in order of ascending indices
    (0, 1, 2, ...), whereas a 2-dimension matrix might be
    11 x 32 elements in size, stepped through columns then
    rows ((0,0), (0,1), (0,2), ..., (1,0), (1,1), ...).
  </p>

  <p>
    The Position class is used to index all of the Regions
    described here, but Regions may be described by other
    indices (such as Integers, Strings, other complex objects,
    and so on).
