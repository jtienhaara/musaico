    Array regions, such as lists of objects, byte streams, and so on.
  </p>

  <p>
    An ArrayRegion is described by a number of indices, typically
    starting at 0 and ending at (size - 1).
  </p>

  <p>
    For example, an array of 32 objects can be described
    by an ArrayRegion with <code> ArraySize ( 32 ) </code>
    and start <code> ArrayPosition ( 0 ) </code>, followed
    by 1, 2, 3, ... and finally end <code> ArrayPosition ( 31 ) </code>.
