    Atomic components of records and objects in Musaico.
  </p>

  <p>
    Akin to the byte in an operating system, Musaico does not
    provide facilities for anything "smaller" than a Field.
  </p>

  <p>
    A Field is comprised of an identifier (the field's "name")
    and a value.
  </p>

  <p>
    The identifier for a Field is always an arbitrary String.
    It need not be unique in any scope whatsoever (although
    particular record types may restrict this freedom).
  </p>

  <p>
    The value must be a "Musaico primitive", such as integer,
    String, date, time, reference, and so on.
  </p>

  <p>
    See the individual Field implementations for details.
  </p>

  <p>
    Musaico can easily be extended to incorporate other "primitive"
    Field values.  See the (as yet unwritten) section on
    primtive typecast inferences.
