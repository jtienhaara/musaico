    Buffers of Fields.
  </p>

  <p>
    Most Buffers used in Musaico are in-memory Buffers which
    provide quick and easy lookup of Fields retrieved from
    records or objects.
  </p>

  <p>
    Buffers can, however, be implemented to read/write directly
    from/to library drivers or anything else desired, for example
    in order to read/write simple objects to/from files, sockets,
    database connections, and so on.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Musaico virtual memory system is built upon Buffers.
    A Page can be swapped in to an in-memory Buffer or written
    to swap space as a persistent Buffer.
  </p>
