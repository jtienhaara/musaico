If, for some particular branch of Buffer implementations, every Field
is just a value, and its position is its name, then all we have to do is:

Position position_i_want = new FieldID ( "my_field" );
Field field_i_want = buffer.get ( position_i_want );

Or:

Field field_i_want = buffer.get ( new FieldID ( "my_field" ) );
