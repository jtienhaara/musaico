 * <p>
 * BufferSpaces are related via a graph (nodes representing BufferSpaces,
 * directed arcs representing relations).  Each directed arc represents
 * the ability for a caller to copy a Buffer from the target BufferSpace
 * to the source ("this") BufferSpace.  This ability is not reciprocal
 * (unless a directed arc exists in the opposite direction).
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * For example, in the following graph, each user space allows copying
 * to and from one kernel.  Kernel # 2 allows Buffers to be copied from
 * kernel # 1, but the reciprocal is not allowed.  No user may copy Buffers
 * to or from any other user.
