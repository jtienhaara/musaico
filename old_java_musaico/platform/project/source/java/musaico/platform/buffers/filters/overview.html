  <pre>
      Buffer buffer = ...;
      Filter only_date_fields = new FieldIDFilter ( "date" );
      Region date_fields = buffer.region ().filter ( only_date_fields );
      Position position;
      for ( position = date_fields.start ()
            ! ( position instanceof NoSuchPosition );
            position = date_fields.step ( position, 1L ) )
      {
          Field date_field = buffer.get ( position );
          ...;
