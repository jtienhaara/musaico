    Search criteria for searching through Buffers.
  </p>

  <p>
    For example, to search linearly through an unsorted buffer
    for the field with id "last_name":
  </p>

  <pre>
      Buffer buffer = ...;
      Criterion last_name_field = new SpecificFieldID ( "last_name" );
      Search search = new LinearSearch ( last_name_field );
      Position last_name_position = search.find ( buffer.region () );
  </pre>

  <p>
    Or to use the buffer's preferred search (binary, linear, and so on)
    to  search through a buffer already sorted by field identifiers
    for the same field:
  </p>

  <pre>
      Buffer sorted_buffer = ...;
      Criterion last_name_field = new SpecificFieldID ( "last_name" );
      Search search = buffer.region ().search ( last_name_field );
      Position last_name_position = search.find ( buffer.region () );
  </pre>
