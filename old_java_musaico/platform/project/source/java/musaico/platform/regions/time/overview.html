    Time regions, such as calendars, schedules and so on.
  </p>

  <p>
    A TimeRegion is described by a number of discrete Times,
    such as Time ( today at 11:00am ), Time (next year ), and
    so on.
  </p>

  <p>
    The size of a TimeRegion is the elapsed time between the
    start Time and end Time.
  </p>

  <p>
    For example, a schedule with start Time ( today at 9:00am )
    followed by hourly Times and finally end Time ( today at 5:00pm )
    would have a TimeSize of 8 hours.
  </p>

  <p>
    Note that Times are measured in UTC, so conversion to or from
    localized calendars must be handled by other libraries.
    (For example, in Java a Time object can be created by
    constructing a musaico.time.AbsoluteTime from a Calendar object.)
