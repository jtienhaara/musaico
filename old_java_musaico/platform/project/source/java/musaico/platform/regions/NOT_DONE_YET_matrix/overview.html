    Matrix regions with discrete cells, such as tables,
    spreadsheets, multi-dimensional arrays, and so on.
  </p>

  <p>
    A MatrixRegion is described by a number of cells, typically
    starting at the origin (such as {0,0,0} in a 3-dimensional
    matrix) and ending at (dimensional size - 1) (such as
    {xSize-1,ySize-1,zSize-1} in a 3-dimensional matrix).
  </p>

  <p>
    For example, a table with 10 rows and 5 columns can
    be described by a MatrixRegion with <code> MatrixSize ( 10, 5 ) </code>
    and start <code> MatrixPosition ( 0, 0 ) </code>, followed
    by {0,1}, {0,2}, {0,3}, ..., {1,0}, {1,1}, {1,2}, ... and
    finally end <code> MatrixPosition ( 9, 4 ) </code>.
