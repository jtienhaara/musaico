/**
 * <p>
 * A Contract in which the method or other service provider gives
 * some guarantee, such as "the return value from this method will
 * never be null".
 * </p>

 *
 * <p>
 * In Java, every Contract must implement equals () and hashCode ().
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * In Java, every Contract must be Serializable in order to play
 * nicely over RMI.
