An arc table has 1 or more "input" table entries, each with an arc to an
output node.  The output node can have state graph, and the arc can have
a transition graph.

A node can have "component" entries in its table, making it a structure.
A node can have a "value" tag.
A node with a "value" tag but no structure is a literal.
A node with no "value" tag and no structure is value-equivalent to null or none.

An arc can have "input" entries in its table, making it a sub-graph.
An arc can have a "filter" tag.
An arc with a "filter" tag but no sub-graph is a conditional arc.
An arc with no "filter" tag and no sub-graph is an automatic arc.
