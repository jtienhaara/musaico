    An "opaque" type is one which the typing systems know nothing
    about.
  </p>

  <p>
    Instances of an OpaqueType are not very useful for the typing
    system.  However when trying to squeeze complex objects into
    Instance format, an OpaqueType can be used in a pinch.  The
    typing systems will not be able to provide any proper typing
    functionality.  But typically this is done in order to pass
    complex data via local communications protocols which rely
    on Instances.
  </p>

  <p>
    For example, a method might be invoked with an array of
    Instances as the parameters.  If that method understands
    FooBar objects, then an Instance can be created to carry
    the FooBar object into the method:
  </p>

  <pre>
    TypingEnvironment typing = ...;
    OpaqueTypeSystem.standard ( typing );
    FooBar my_foobar = ...;
    Instance foobar_instance = typing.create ( Object.class, my_foobar );
    Instance [] parameters = { ..., foobar_instance, ... };
    xyz.doSomething ( parameters );
  </pre>
