    Variety of Tags.  A Tag may be add to the set of Tags for
    an Instance, or for a Type, or for a TypeSystem, and so on.
  </p>

  <p>
    The most widely used Tags are Types, defined elsewhere.
    Constraints are also Tags, and are also defined elsewhere.
    This module contains Tags which do not fit the other categories,
    such as simple flags.
  </p>

  <p>
    For example, a PrivacyTag might be added to an Instance to
    indicate that its data should not be shared across the network
    nor stored without encryption.
