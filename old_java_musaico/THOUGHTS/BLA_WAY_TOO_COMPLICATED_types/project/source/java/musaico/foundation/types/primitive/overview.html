    A "primitive" in Musaico is an instance of some particular
    PrimitiveType, such as a string, a number, a date, and
    so on.
  </p>

  <p>
    A number of builtin PrimitiveTypes are available and interchangeable
    across programming language and operating system / hardware
    boundaries.  For example, text, numbers, dates, times, timezones,
    URLs, and so on.
  </p>

  <p>
    Converting a Primitive from one Type to another is a
    simple matter.  For example, to convert from a text
    value to an integer:
  </p>

  <pre>
      String text = "0xA7";
      Primitive x = type_systems.create ( StringType.class, text );
      int number = x.value ( IntType.class );
  </pre>

  <p>
    In cases where a duplicate value is always desired,
    even if the primitives are of the same type, the
    Type's <code> duplicate () </code> method can be used:
  </p>

  <pre>
      Primitive x = type_systems.create ( StringType.class, "Hello, world!" );
      Primitive y = type_systems.duplicate ( x );
  </pre>

  <p>
    If the Type to use for a Primitive is unknown,
    then the TypeSystems can figure it out:
  </p>

  <pre>
      Object foo = ...;
      Primitive x = type_systems.create ( foo );
  </pre>
