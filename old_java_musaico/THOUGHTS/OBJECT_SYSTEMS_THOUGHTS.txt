Asynchronous requests & responses:
Every "do something" operation (read(), write(), etc) returns
a request which can then be queried for result / failure result /
throw exception, and for synhronous behaviour call waitFor ().
See MemoryRequest for example usage.

Then read(), for example, would return MemoryRequest<Region> rather
than Region, and would not ever block.  The system call could
receive the MemoryRequest response and block accordingly, but
it might be better to just translate & pass back essentially the
same type of object to user space -- and let the user space
system decide whether or not to block.

                                      * "meta" (object) [1]
                                          can contain meta-Documents
                                          such as notes, review comments,
                                          author, copyright notice, and
                                          so on.
                                      * "media" (object) [1]
                                          can contain Images and (depending
                                          on the derived object system)
                                          possibly other media formats.


Tableosys:

                     Table (object)
                           |
           ________________|________________
          |                |                |
          | [1]            | [1]            | [1]
      "rows" (object)  "columns" (object)  "cells" (object)
          |                |                |
         /|\ [0..n]       /|\ [0..n]       /|\ [0..n]
        Row (object)    Column (object)   Cell (object)
          |                |                    |
         /|\ [0..n]       /|\ [0..n]        depends (see below)...
    Cell (hard link)   Cell (hard link)

    The content of a Cell object depends on the object
    system.  For example, a table from a database most
    likely only contains fields, no child objects.  A
    table from a spreadsheet, on the other hand, most
    likely contains a Document.


Seriesosys:

                    Series (object)
                         |___________
                         |           \
                        /|\ [0..n]    \ [1]
                   Frame (object)    "frame_rate" (field)

    The content of the Frame object depends on the
    object system.  For example, a Video might contain
    an Image and an Audio in each Frame, whereas an
    Audio might contain 2 or 6 or N Samples in each
    Frame (one per track).

    The frame_rate is typically expressed in frames per second,
    but other units can conceivably be used instead of seconds.


Imageosys:

                      Table (object)
                           /_\
                            |
                      Image (object)
                   Each Cell contains:

                      Colour (object)
                            |
                           /|\
            Typically "red", "green", "blue", "opacity"/"alpha" fields


Audiosys:

                      Series (object)
                            /_\
                             |
                      Audio (object) --------------> "samples_per_frame",
                   Each Frame contains:        [1]   "num_channels"

                     * "audio" (field) [one per channel/track]
                     * AudioFilterLink / AudioEffectLink (relations) [0..n]
                     * Bookmark (marker field) [0..n]

    "audio" is a byte[] field with (samples_per_frame) samples.
    There are (num_channels) "audio" fields per Frame.


Videosys:

                      Audio (object) (see audiosys)
                            /_\
                             |
                      Video (object) --------------> "frame_width",
                   Each Frame contains:        [1]   "frame_height"

                     * "image" (object) [1] Initially a black image,
                       always "frame_width" x "frame_height" table size.
                     * VideoFilterLink / VideoEffectLink (relations) [0..n]
                     * Bookmark (marker field) [0..n]




Example object systems:

Excelosys:

              Document (object) (see documentosys)
                            /_\
                             |
                      Workbook (object)
                             |
                             |
                            /|\ [0..n]
                       Sheet (object) -----|> Table (see tableosys)
                     Each Cell contains:
                   * Document (object) [0..1] (see documentosys)

    Additions to documentosys:
    * "formula" (flat record) [0..1] can be placed wherever PlainText and so on
      can be placed.

Maybe Excelosys doesn't exist.  Maybe Excel is just a driver
after all...
