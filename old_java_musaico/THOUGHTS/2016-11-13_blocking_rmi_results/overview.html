  <p>
    A Blocking value can be returned from an operation that is incomplete,
    so that the caller chooses whether to process the result
    synchronously (after waiting for it to complete),
    asynchronously (in the background when the operation is complete),
    or piecemeal asynchronously (in the background whenever a new element
    is available, and also when the operation completes).
