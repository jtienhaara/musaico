- Rename "ObjectContracts" to "Advocate", and "TrackingContracts"
  to "TrackingAdvocate".
- Add helpful information to Contracts and Violations:
    - Contract.description () : String
      Human-readable (one locale only) text to explain the nature
      and use of the contract.
    - Violation.explanation () : String
      A detailed explanation of how the contract was violation,
      including the contract description, as well as some extra
      information such as where the violation happened
      (e.g. one stack frame above a method call for a violated obligation,
      or the stack frame of the method call for a violated guarantee).
- Think about whether there is any place for "quality" Values
  (Inaccurate, Imprecise, with accuracy () : Value<BigDecimal>
  or precision () : Value<BigDecimal> and so on, or maybe just
  plain old quality () : Value<BigDecimal> -- using composition
  such as Imprecise<Inaccurate<XYZ>> to get access to both types
  of quality).
