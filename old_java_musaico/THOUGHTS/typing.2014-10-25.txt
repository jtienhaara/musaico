From Template.java (2012-11-25):
====
Instance gets renamed to Term.

Variable is derived from Term.  It has no value?!?  Or something...

A Buffer can be a set of instructions for use as a Function.

A stream has a Type.  A stream of Strings might have a Text[1..n] Type,
    while a stream which inputs or outputs an object of a specific
    Type would have that Type.  An input and an output stream cannot
    be connected if they do not have the same Type.  Two streams of
    the same Type can be concatenated into a stream of Type X[n].
    Two streams of different Types can be concatenated into a stream
    of Type [X, Y].

A Function reads from 0 or more input streams and writes to 0 or more output
  streams.  Its Type is comprised of the set of in and out stream Types.
  If an input stream has type X then feeding it from an output stream
  of type X[n] means all input streams have to have type ABC[n] and
  the function is executed [n] times, once for each set of input parameters.
