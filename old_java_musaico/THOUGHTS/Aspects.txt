Aspects of typical objects:

- Security
- Mutex
- Logger
- Statistics
- Contracts, violations and arbiters


Security
+ request ( Credentials, Capability... ) : Permissions
+ capabilities () : Capability []

Permissions
+ credentials () : Credentials
+ capabilities () : Capability []
maybe some way to have timeouts

Credentials can contain lots of context (e.g. process, ONode, etc in kernel).

Mutex
+ lock ( Credentials, timeout ) : Conditional<MutexLock>

Logger
+ log ( Level, String )

StatisticsBuilder
+ onError ( String )
+ onTimeout ( String )
+ build () : Statistics

Statistics
+ errors () : long
+ timeouts () : long
