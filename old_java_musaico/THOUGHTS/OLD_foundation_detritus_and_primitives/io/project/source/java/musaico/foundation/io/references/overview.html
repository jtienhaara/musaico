    Hard and soft reference implementations.
  </p>

  <p>
    SimpleSoftReferences can be used to reference an object
    by some identifier unique within the object's namespace
    (such as a String name, or an integer index into an array,
    and so on).
  </p>

  <p>
    In Java, SimpleHardReference points to an object in a given
    JVM.  It can be shared across JVMs since it implements the
    RemoteObject interface.
