- Distribution is a type, defined something like:

  type distribution {
      software system;
      package [] packages;
  }

  So you can declare one with something like:

  distribution my_distro = {
      system = musaico;
      packages = {
          musaico/excel, musaico/tomcat, musaico/pdf
      };
  };

  Something along the lines of a Docker container (maybe distribution
  is an extension of a container type).
