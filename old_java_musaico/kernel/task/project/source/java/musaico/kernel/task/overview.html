    Scheduling classes.  Useful for executing tasks on schedule.
  </p>

  <p>
    Each Task does the bulk of its work during its <code> execute () </code>
    call.  Depending on the Scheduler and the Schedule for the particular
    Task, it might be executed over and over again (either on a
    periodic schedule or on an irregular schedule).
  </p>

  <p>
    The Scheduler also takes a Priority for each Task to schedule,
    so higher priority Tasks might get "real-time" priority scheduling,
    while lower priority Tasks might get low "batch" priority scheduling.
    Note that the effect of the Priority on scheduling depends on
    both the Scheduler and the underlying system.  (Attempting to
    schedule a Task as "real-time" in a system not
    configured for such, or even in a process not configued properly,
    might produce disappointing results.)
  </p>

  <p>
    Note that a given Task can be scheduled in multiple different
    Schedulers.  Concurrency / thread-safety must be taken into
    consideration by the developer who reuses Tasks.
