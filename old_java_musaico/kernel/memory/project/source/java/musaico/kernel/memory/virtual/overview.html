    A buffer of Fields covering a Segment of virtual memory.
  </p>

  <p>
    When a particular Field is requested from a virtual Buffer,
    the corresponding Page is checked.  If it is in memory already,
    then the appropriate Field is returned.  If it is not in
    memory, then the operation blocks while the Page is
    swapped in (or even swapped out, from cache for example)
    to buffer memory.
