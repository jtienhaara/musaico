    The Musaico kernel.
  </p>

  <p>
    The kernel is responsible for memory management, drivers,
    object systems, and process management.
  </p>

  <p>
    Memory management entails providing sufficient buffers to
    the object systems and user space to keep blocks of Fields
    in memory for quick access, while staying within acceptable
    boundaries to prevent the application system from hogging
    system memory.  When necessary (such as when an application
    loads a very large document into memory), the kernel may
    swap out buffers.
  </p>

  <p>
    Drivers provide input into the application system and output
    from it.  Applications indirectly or directly use Drivers to
    retrieve and store persistent data or communicate across
    the network to other applications or kernels.  A Driver
    might provide access to a SQL database, an HTTP server,
    an in-memory object, and so on.  Driver stacks are also possible,
    so that, for example, the data written to or retrieved from
    a persistent file Driver might be translated to or from XML
    or JSON or YAML, and so on.
  </p>

  <p>
    Object systems are akin to file systems in a UNIX environment.
    They are hierarchically-organized structures of documents.
    A document might be a simple record of fields, a symbolic
    link to another document elsewhere in the system, a driver
    which can handle requests, or a more complex object which
    (like a directory in a file system) can contain child documents.
    The object systems are the main organizing principle behind
    applications running in the Musaico environment: Since
    tedious details such as serialization of data, guaranteed
    transactions, and inter-process communication are all
    handled by the application system, the application developer
    need only organize objects to best suit her needs, and
    then provide an interface for ths user.  Meanwhile, another
    developer can build a complementary or supplemental interface
    to the same object layout.  Finally, a third developer can
    replace the object layout and reuse the interface for the
    same look and feel on a completely different set of
    information.
  </p>

  <p>
    Process management governs how programs are executed and
    how processes are scheduled.  Programs may include full-blown
    applications, or simpler text-based utilities which can
    be glued together to form quick and dirty applications.
