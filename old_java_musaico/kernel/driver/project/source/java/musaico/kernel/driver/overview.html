    The library driver interfaces for Musaico.
  </p>

  <p>
    Drivers provide access to persistent storage (SQL
    databases, file systems), networking (sockets, HTTP,
    and so on), in-memory information (reflection/introspection
    and so on), and any other object and document access
    points desired.
  </p>

  <p>
    Each Driver provides read/write functionality as
    well as more specialized request commands.
  </p>

  <p>
    Drivers can be stacked on top of other Drivers to provide
    "Driver stacks".
  </p>

  <p>
    For example, a filter to read/write XML data might be
    stacked on top of a SQL database Driver or an HTTP client
    Driver to parse and format XML messages for persistent
    storage (for example, for guaranteed delivery) or to
    send to a web server.
  </p>

  <p>
    The library drivers are modeled loosely after Linux
    device drivers.  An excellent treatise on the subject:

    <a href="http://www.xml.com/ldd/chapter/book/">
      Linux Device Drivers (older edition)
    </a>
  </p>

  <p>
    The concept of stackable Drivers is modeled <i>very</i> loosely
    on the SVR3 STREAMS framework, though it is also meant to
    be much simpler.
