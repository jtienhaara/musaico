    Specialized ONode interfaces, such as FlatONode (fields only),
    ObjectONode (hierarchical) and Relation.
  </p>

  <p>
    These ONode types mirror the different types of files
    in a UNIX-like operating system (file, directory, symbolic
    link, and so on).
  </p>

  <p>
    Each specialized ONode interface may provide additional
    methods and/or constraints on the behaviour of its
    methods beyond what the generic ONode provides.
  </p>

  <p>
    For example, an object system describing cars might
    provide an ONode class for "car" which implements the
    hierarchical ObjectoNode interface, so that a car can
    have 4 wheels; ONode class for "wheel" which
    implements the FlatONode interface, so that a wheel
    can have size attributes; ONode class for the
    car's radio, which provides a Relation to radion stations
    possibly in other object systems; and so on.  While the
    "car" ONode class must implement ObjectONode, it
    need not implement the FlatONode interface which
    "wheel" implements, and vice-versa.
  </p>
    

  <p>
    Typical object systems are able to read and write all of
    the main specialized ONode types:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li> FlatONodes: ONodes with only fields, no hierarchy of
         child ONodes. </li>
    <li> ObjectONodes: ONodes which may contain fields and/or
         child ONode. </li>
    <li> Relations: ONodes which refer to other ONodes, such
         as symbolic links, and possibly other Relation extensions
         (for example, joins, transaction umbrellas, and so on).
  </ul>

  <p>
    The Relation ONode type is quite flexible, allowing the
    object system to recognize only that there is a Relation
    in the hierarchy, while the Relation's "magic number"
    (type of relation) specifies the kernel factory which
    will create the specific Relation-derived instance.
  </p>

  <p>
    For example, if the "foobar" object system type is
    released in year X, and 2 years later a new Relation
    called "RandomTraversal" is added to the Musaico kernel,
    then any "foobar" object system can take advantage of
    the new RandomTraversal relation, without the need for
    recompiling.
