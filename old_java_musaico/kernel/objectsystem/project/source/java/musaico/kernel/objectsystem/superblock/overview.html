    The SuperBlock of an object system.
  </p>

  <p>
    The SuperBlock in Musaico corresponds roughly to the super block
    in a UNIX-like file system.
  </p>

  <p>
    A SuperBlock defines one object system of a particular type.
    object systems might exist for each type, and multiple types
    of object systems might also exist.  For example, one type
    might provide direct access to ONode data, whereas another might
    be journalled.  One SuperBlock might exist to store the
    applications in the system, another for users' "home" objects,
    another for a product database, and so on.
