    A standard simple OEntry which can refer to ONodes anywhere in
    any object system by path, and also a virtual OEntry which can
    be used to point through symbolically linked paths to an ONode.

  <p>
    An OEntry in Musaico is similar to a dentry (directory entry)
    in a UNIX-like operation system.
