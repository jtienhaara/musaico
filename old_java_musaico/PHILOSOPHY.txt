A Co-Operating system is designed to encourage co-operation:

  - between a software developer and other software developers
  - between a software system and other software systems
  - between a software user and other software users
  - and each mixed with the others (between a software developer
    and software users and vice-versa; between a software system
    and sotware users and vice-versa; between a software system
    and software developers and vice-versa).

The Musaico Co-Operating System, being Free Software, incorporates additional
design goals:

  - To encourage the adoption of Free software;
  - to encourage the philosophy of Free software.

To these ends, Musaico should make it easy for non-Free software users
and developers to enter the world of Free software.  But the experience
should ideally be so far superior to the experiences non-Free software
users and developers are used to that many users and developers will
embrace the philosophy of Freedom.

As a corollary, Musaico is designed specifically NOT to limit the
freedoms of users or developers working with non-Free software.
To this end the maintainers of Musaico shall endeavour to support
integration with non-Free software systems, without restricting
or limiting that integration in any way, while demonstrating and
espousing the benefits of their Free software counterparts.

The build system of Musaico, clunky and ugly and difficult to maintain,
is an example of what happens when a door is closed in the face of
a software developer who wants to maximize Freedom without cutting
off access to non-Free tools.  A major software system Free build tool
with no support for a major non-Free compiler is a perfect example
of how to turn away newcomers to the world of Free software.

Musaico is Free software.  It is also a Co-operating system.
Freedom and Co-operation shall be maintained in balance and harmony.
