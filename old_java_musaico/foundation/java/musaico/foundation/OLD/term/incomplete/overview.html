    Incomplete terms, including Partial values (which can never
    be completed), as well as the basis for other incomplete
    terms (such as Blocking terms, which will possibly complete
    some day, and guaranteed-to-complete terms, such as expressions
    to be evaluated on complete input terms, without interacting
    with the outside world, and so on).
