Something more abstract and generic than symbol types.

Maybe something that, when you feed Type(s) into it, it spits
out symbol types.

  publi class TypeClass {
    public AbstractFoo [] requirements () { ... }
  }

  public abstract class Foo {
    public TypeClass typeClass () { ... }
  }

  public class Foo1 extends Foo {
    public SymbolID<?> [] requiredSymbolIDs ( Type ) { ... }
  }

  public class Foo2 extends Foo {
    public SymbolID<?> [] requiredSymbolIDs ( Type, Type ) { ... }
  }

  public class Foo3 extends Foo {
    public SymbolID<?> [] requiredSymbolIDs ( Type, Type, Type ) { ... }
  }

  ...etc...

Maybe TypeClass should also cover multiple Types, since Point is
tied to the hip of Measure.
