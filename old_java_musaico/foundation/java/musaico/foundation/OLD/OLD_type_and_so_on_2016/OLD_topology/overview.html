    Descrptions of the topological spaces occupied by data structures,
    and how to perform various operations on them (stepping through
    them linearly, adding, subtracting, intersecting, and so on).
  </p>

  <p>
    For example, a vector might be 17 elements in size and
    stepped through in order of ascending indices
    (0, 1, 2, ...), whereas a 2-dimension matrix might be
    11 x 32 elements in size, stepped through columns then
    rows ((0,0), (0,1), (0,2), ..., (1,0), (1,1), ...).
