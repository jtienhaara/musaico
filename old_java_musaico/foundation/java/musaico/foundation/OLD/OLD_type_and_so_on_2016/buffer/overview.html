    Buffers of Values are akin to arrays in C, linear data structures
    which can be used as the underpinnings for more complex types
    such as trees, or as abstractions for accessing data from any sources
    in a uniform manner, akin to the way arrays are used in C to access
    various file system structures and disk layouts.
  </p>

  <p>
    Most Buffers used in Musaico are in-memory Buffers which
    provide quick and easy lookup of Fields retrieved from
    records or objects.
  </p>

  <p>
    Buffers can, however, be implemented to read/write directly
    from/to library drivers or anything else desired, for example
    in order to read/write simple objects to/from files, sockets,
    database connections, and so on.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Musaico virtual memory system is built upon Buffers.
    A Page can be swapped in to an in-memory Buffer or written
    to swap space as a persistent Buffer.
