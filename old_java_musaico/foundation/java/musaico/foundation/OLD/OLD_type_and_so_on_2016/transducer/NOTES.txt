- A Processor is a StateMachine.
  - InputTransition takes a Transaction off the stack, determines whether
    the Processor can execute it, and either puts it back on the stack,
    or executes it.
- Every StateMachine can have a parent.  parent () : ZeroOrOne<StateMachine>.
  - So the input StateMachine to a Transaction's logic has its
    parent pointing to the Transaction StateMachine.
  - Ditto for the logic.
  - The world/context, though, does not point to the Transaction as its parent.
- OR the StateMachine could have Arc(s) to represent its relations
  to other StateMachines.
- Either way, there is structure outside the core Graph.
  The Graph doesn't need to be modified, only the StateMachine.
