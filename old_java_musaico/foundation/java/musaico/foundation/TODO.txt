Restructuring
=============
We are throwing away Elements.java (in a sense).
Countable.java already has everything we need and more.
We have been bending over backwards trying to make a second
"ArrayObject" that we don't need.

Old structure and order:

filter
    composite
domains
    generators
    iterators
    elements
    comparability
    equality
    number
    array
    string
    time
contract
    obligations
    guarantees
order
capability
    operating
    permission
pipeline
term
    pipeline
    multiplicities
    contracts
    iterators
    countable
    infinite
    abnormal
    incomplete
    expression
    generators
    builder
graph
operation
    primitive


Restructured:

include
    filter
    contract
    order
    capability
    pipeline
    term
    graph
    operation

source
    procedure (ClassName, StringRepresentation, etc)
    structure (HashedObject, BloomFilter, etc)
    iterator
    filter
        composite
        comparability
        equality
        number
        string
        time
    contract
        obligation
        guarantee
    order
    capability
        operating
        permission
    pipeline
    term
        structure (was pipeline)
        multiplicity
        ??? maybe filter ???
        contract
        iterator
        countable
        infinite
        abnormal
        incomplete
        expression
        generator
        builder
    graph
    operation
        primitive


Except we can't do that, because the includes require concrete Contracts
like Parameter1.MustNotBeNull.
So restructured again:

include
    filter
        composite
        comparability
        equality
        number
        string
        time
    contract
        obligation
        guarantee
    order
    capability
    pipeline
    term
    graph
    operation

source
    procedure (ClassName, StringRepresentation, etc)
    structure (HashedObject, BloomFilter, etc)
    iterator
    filter
    contract
    order
    capability
        operating
        permission
    pipeline
    term
        structure (was pipeline)
        multiplicity
        ??? maybe filter ???
        contract
        iterator
        countable
        infinite
        abnormal
        incomplete
        expression
        generator
        builder
    graph
    operation
        primitive



The include/source divide seems pointless now.
Back to more or less the original, no include/source division:

    procedure (ClassName, StringRepresentation, etc)
    structure (HashedObject, BloomFilter, etc)
    iterator
    filter
        composite
        comparability
        equality
        number
        string
        time
    contract
        obligation
        guarantee
    order
    capability
        operating
        permission
    pipeline
    term
        structure (was pipeline)
        multiplicity
        ??? maybe filter ???
        contract
        iterator
        countable
        infinite
        abnormal
        incomplete
        expression
        generator
        builder
    graph
    operation
        primitive
