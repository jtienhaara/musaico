  <p>
    Implementations of the Type interface, each of which provides
    the class of, and a domain for additional filtering of, the elements
    of a Term, a contract for each Term as a whole, and a "none" value
    (such as 0 or "" or an empty array, and so on).
  </p>

  <p>
    "None" values are used whenever a caller does not
    want to handle an exception, null, or some other unusual result,
    and so calls <code> Term.orNone () <code>.
